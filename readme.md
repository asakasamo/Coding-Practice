# My Coding Practice

This repo contains code I've written for practice (mostly my solutions to coding puzzles on Codewars). It's a good demonstration of what it looks like when I'm just coding on the fly - I didn't spend more than a day on any of the code here.

The subfolders of the repo correspond to the language the code is written in (e.g. Java code is in the "Java" folder).

### Feel free to comment!

This is all "finished" code, but I'm open to any and all feedback!
