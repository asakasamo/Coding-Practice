My Coding Practice
---
*aka "katas and stuff"*
***

This repo contains code I've written for practice. Most of it was written crudely and off the cuff, 
so you won't see much in terms of test files or sophisticated installation instructions.

To see it work, just copy the code, paste it into your IDE (or whatever), and run it. 

### What is this repository for?

Showing what my "quick code" looks like

### Contribution guidelines

This is all "finished" code, but I'm open to any and all feedback.
